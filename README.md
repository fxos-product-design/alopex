# Project Alopex

*begun August 2015*

Project Alopex is an early stage exploration of the future of Mozilla's Firefox OS. You can find more information about schedule, milestones, and the like on the [Mozilla Wiki][1].


### Purpose of This Repo
We want to share our Project Alopex work with Mozilla colleagues outside our immediate team, with the larger Mozilla community, and with others who support the [Mozilla mission][2]. We hope you'll get involved by brainstorming with us, providing feedback, or maybe even submitting a possible design!


### How to Contribute (for everyone)
The best way to get involved is to review the [Open Issues][3], and see what we're working on. Join the conversation in any Open Issue by posting your comments, feedback, ideas, or possible designs.

*Tips:* 

1. "Watch" or "Star" this repo so you receive notifications when new issues are opened.
2. Filter the Open Issues using the Labels to narrow to your areas of interest.
3. Start with items labeled "Feedback wanted" - these are our top priorities and typically have a feedback due date.

# Project Alopex

_begun August 2015_

Here you'll find product design artifacts describing Project Alopex. Out of this work, we plan to define release candidates for upcoming versions of Firefox OS. You can find more information about schedule, milestones, and the like on the [Mozilla Wiki][1].

The purpose of this repo is to share early Project Alopex documents with Mozilla colleagues outside our immediate team, the larger Mozilla community, and others who support the [Mozilla mission][1]. We hope you'll get involved by brainstorming with us, providing feedback, and maybe even submitting a possible design!

The best way to get involved is by browsing the files in the Shared Documents folder and then join the related conversation in the Open Issues.

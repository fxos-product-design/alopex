# Misc


### How to use this directory (for FxOS Product + UX team members)
Use this folder to experiment with Github - you can create, edit, and delete files locally and use the Github Desktop client to push them here.

See the [general instructions][1] for adding/updating files and for soliciting feedback. 

You can also add text-based files into this folder. If the file extension is `.md`, you can use [this cheatsheet][2] for Github Markdown formatting.
